## The scripts of this directory make use of the NAF analysis falicity ##
## You need a NAF account in order to use them ##

Scripts that run the full chain using the new simulation framework.
A generator file is required.

The reco_ilc.sh script will run 10 parallel jobs that call the runSimReco.sh which does:

1) Simulation: use of ddsim tool. The input - output files, steering file
geometry, number of events and start event number are given as command line arguments. By default, a ZH->mumuX stdhep file is used.

2) Reconstruction: The user has to source some HEAD ILCSoft installation.
The steering files used for reconstruction are the steering files that resides
in the ILDConfig/lcgeo_current directory of the used ILCSoft installation.
 - That will not work for reference installation, since we don't install the ILDConfig in them -

The motivation of this approach is to avoid duplication of the std reconstruction steering files.

3) LCTuple: The LCTuple processor is applied on the produced reconstructed files. The obtained root files are merged and fed to the analysis.

The above 3 steps are performed by sourcing   reco_ilc.sh.
It is fairly straightforward to modify the reco_ilc.sh in order to change
the number of events (2nd argument) & startEventNumber (3rd argument), the filename (1st arg. ) or add or remove jobs.

The generator file, detector geometry and steering files can be modified from the   runSimReco.sh (INFILE, GEARFILE and COMPACTFILE variables)

4) Analysis: A macro that reconstructs and fits the Higgs recoil mass will be provided. This macro is made by Elena Volkova as a part of her summer student work in DESY.
