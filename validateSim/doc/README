The idea is of this processor is to produce a basic set of
plots to validate (or find problems) in a simulation model.

Example distributions are of hit energies and time, position, and cell indices.

The /test/ directory has a few scripts which can be used to produce a simple simulation file,
and run the validation processor over it (sim_and_check.sh).

Each hit collection is treated by one instance of the processor, and produced a root file for that collection.

The plotallhits.C macro produces a .ps file with a selection of these plots.
