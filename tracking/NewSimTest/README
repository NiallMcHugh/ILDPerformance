Directory to test the new simulation framework.

The script runNewSim.sh, generates, simulates, reconstructs and analyses 1000 single tracks (by default muons - the user may change that, see below for generation), for various momenta and polar angles, using DD4hep.

Important: the user needs to source init_ilcsoft.sh and edit the variable ILDConfig
to point to the path of the corresponding ILDConfig directory.

generation: the python script lcio_particle_gun.py creates MCParticles. It takes as arguments
1. momentum
2. polar angle
3. output file name
4. particle pdg code
5. particle's charge

One might use particle gun instead. In that case, comment out the line that runs lcio_particle_gun.py and
turn on the particle gun inside file ddsim_steer.py (see below)

simulation: it runs ddsim, using by default assteering file ILDConfig/StandardConfig/lcgeo_current/ddsim_steer.py 
A number of arguments can be used (have a look at ddsim_steer.py)
by default we are using 
1. input file name
2. output file name
3. compact file
4. steering file
5. number of events



reconstruction: we are using the standard reco file, at ILDCONFIG/StandardConfig/lcgeo_current/bbudsc_3evt_stdreco_dd4hep.xml


refitting: runs the refit processor. The user can choose between aidaTT and DDKalTest tracking system, by editing
the file run_refit_aidaTT.xml and modifying appropriately the processor parameter TrackSystemName

 

analysis: runs the diagnostics processor on the reconstructed files. It produces a root file, which stores
performance canvases (efficiency - pulls - residuals) and a TTree with track info.
