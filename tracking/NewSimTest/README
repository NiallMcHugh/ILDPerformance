Directory to test the new simulation framework.
Experimental, currently it requires HEAD versions of the ilcsoft packages.

The script runNewSim.sh, generates, simulates, reconstructs and analyses 1000 single muon
tracks, for various momenta and polar angles, using DD4hep.
It simulates a simplified detector model, which consists of VXD and a pixel-like SIT.

generation: the python script lcio_particle_gun.py creates MCParticles. It takes as arguments
the momentum, the polar angle and the name of the output lcio file which holds the MCParticles collection.

simulation: runNewSim.py
It takes as arguments the compact xml file describing the detector geometry
(default is the simple ILD model, the user can modify that)
the name of the input MCParticles lcio file
and the name of the output simulation lcio file.

reconstruction: run_sitracking.xml
as it is obvious by its name, this marlin steering file runs the digitisers on the simple ILD model, 
and reconstructs silicon tracks.
The gear file gear_SimpleILD_DD4hep.xml, which corresponds to the simple ILD geometry is provided.
The user may replace it with another steering/gear files. 

refitting with aidaTT: this part is currently commented it out, until aida tracking toolkit is
completed, debugged and tested.

analysis: runs the diagnostics processor on the reconstructed files. It produces a root file, which stores
performance canvases (efficiency - pulls - residuals) and a TTree with track info.
