Standard test for WW -> 4 jets (udsc)
=====================================

- input:
* DST / REC file with PFO collection
  (Pandora or ???)

- runs
* jet finding (excl kt 4 jets + beam jets, cone R = 1.3)     
* 5C kinematic fit (E, p, equal mass)

- plots
* jet mass
* number of iterations
* fit probability
* fitted W mass

Instructions
==============

0) initialize Marlin

1) insert path to your input DST / REC file to test in
   scripts/WW5CFit.xml
    
   [optionally: adjust output level, number of events, 
                name of output root file etc] 
                
   if not ILD_o1_v05, copy your gear files and adjust in steering             

2) run 
   $MALIN/bin/Marlin scripts/WW5CFit.xml
   
   this writes root file 
   rootfiles/WW5CFit_test.root
    
3) go to macros, start root and run

   .x WW5CFit_compare.C

   [if needed change input rootfile name here as well]
   
   This compares the above distributions from the test file with a 
   reference file [provided in macros] and creates pdf and eps files ofthe canvas
   
   The reference histograms will be normalized to the same content as the test histogram!
