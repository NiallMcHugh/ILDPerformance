Release Notes:


 --------
| v01-01 ?|  
 --------

kinfit (J.List):
   - new reference histogram file for ZH5CFit 
   - reference histograms for pull distributions
   

 --------
| v01-00 |  
 --------
D. Jeans
  - add simulation validation processor, examples and short documentation
  - extend for CalorimeterHits and TrackerHits; a few other cleanups
M. Petric
   - Added GSL because required. It would however better to fix aidaTT to propagate GSL properly

H.L. Tran
   - Modify CMakeLists.txt file to include the validateSim folder.

J. List
   - added ZH5CFit
   - added ZH example
   - added first version of test on WW->4jets
   - added likelihood values for all hypotheses as LiPDG_mu etc to PIDtree; == 9 means is -inf on DST =>check with Masakazu?; == 2 means no PID or no recoParticle existing for this MCP
  - significantly improved truth vs reco navigation
  - added dEdx distance and dEdx likelihood to tree)

Y. Voutsinas
   - add a diagnostics script that run a simple analysis hZ->mumuX for Mokka as well
   - processor that calculates track - hit residuals based on aidaTT intersection calculation added
   - updating tracking performance macros, track resolution performance plots

F. Gaede
   - - finalized plotting of dE/dx for all particle types ( code from P.McKeown )
   - made compatible with c++11
   - removed -ansi -pedantic -Wno-long-long
   -  added trueMass to PID TTree
   - added macro plotdEdx
   - bug fix for getParents.size()==0
