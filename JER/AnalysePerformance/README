In order to calculate the energy resolution (RMS90), one has to source the script
runEnergyRes.sh

What that script does is:

1) runs the PFOAnalysis processor of PandoraAnalysis, which produces a plot with the sum of the energy of all PFOs of the event

2) runs a macro tht reads the above mentioned histogram and calculates the RMS90 and its uncertainty

The calculated value are printed at the screen (the user can access the histogram also from the produced ROOT file)

The user needs to provide a reconstructed lcio file (up to MarlinPandora)
The name of the file should be given to the variable INFILE, in the runEnergyRes.sh script.
Via the script one may also change the gear file (in case a different detector design is under study)
